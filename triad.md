I created a 3D printed enclosure to block ambient light and hold the [AS7265x Spectral Triad](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15050). 

The data can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18tIvDpiz1NvjK_i_9pyhub3FySeUjG97rWv8cSUtHuc/edit?usp=sharing). 

First, I compared the spectra measured for clear tap water with water containing green food coloring. The Spectral Triad takes measurements continuously, so I just averaged 5 consecutive measurements for each variant.
